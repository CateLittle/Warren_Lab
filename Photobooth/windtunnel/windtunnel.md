(https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/)
* Using the above link in order to work on the timelapse capacity for the Pi and integrating that into the script

* code currently works great, but only the manual input
    * for manual input please include a section for the user to preview the image before saving

* Need to develop a timelapse script
    * Do this for 5-10fps 
    * Need to determine the max fps and then makybe try to get 10fps 
    * Set a start and stop time... and do the while loop until end of time...
* Need to work with the witty pi to determine whether we can utlize that
* Also determine a new method for accessing the internet on the pi
    * What is the method for this?


## 1/20/2022
* Completed the manual input imaging script for the windtunnel
    * 
* Working on developing the timelapse script as well...

* Need to make sure to consider that when developing this programing to keep it robust but also similar in the same aspect
    * So with this in mind I will try to minimize excessive use of the inputs and try to keep things as quick as possible for the user 
    * BUT also keep the clarity of the print statemens so the user knows where they are in the file and what they are able to do...
