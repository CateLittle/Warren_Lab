# Wind Tunnel Fly Trap Imager Program Notes

## 1/18/2022
* Need to make sure to consider that when developing this programing to keep it robust but also similar in the same aspect
    * So with this in mind I will try to minimize excessive use of the inputs and try to keep things as quick as possible for the user 
    * BUT also keep the clarity of the print statemens so the user knows where they are in the file and what they are able to do...
