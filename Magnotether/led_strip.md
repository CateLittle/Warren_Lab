> After installing, open the terminal, and run the following command to convert from the zip
'tar xvf [FILENAME']
> After which point go into the newly created unzipped folder and run the following command:
'sudo ./install.sh'
    * Try first without running sudo, but if that doesn't work then implement the sudo command
> Now the application should install, and try initially running the application by writing:
'Arduino'
> The application is now open, attempt to connect your device by going to tools -> Board -> Board Manager and installing the necessary boards to the IDE.
